					<p><font color="FEFBF6"><strong>Jacob Elordi</strong>(born 26 June 1997) is an Australian actor. After moving to Los Angeles in 2017 to pursue an acting career, he gained prominence with his role as Noah Flynn, the bad boy love interest in the The Kissing Booth film trilogy (2018–2021) on Netflix. He also became known for his main role as the troubled high school football player Nate Jacobs on the HBO teen drama series Euphoria (2019–present). His film roles as Elvis Presley in the biopic Priscilla and as a wealthy university student in Saltburn (both 2023) brought him wider recognition and earned him critical praise. The latter earned him a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. <br><br> He shot up to fame with playing the all-perfect teen jock in the film "kissing booth". Although according to Elordi he hated the stereotype of being a teen jock and wanted to focus on more mature roles. <br> Elordi then got even more recognition as he went on to play Nate Jacobs in the series "Euphoria" and his role of Elivis Presley in the biopic "Priscilla" <br> The latest film where you can see Jacob is the film "Saltburn" which got him alot of praise as well.</p></font>

					<p class="h5"><u><font color="FEFBF6">Early Life</font></u></p>

					<p><font color="FEFBF6">Jacob Elordi was born on 26 June 1997[1] in Brisbane, Queensland, to a working class family consisting of his parents—John, a house painter who spent 13 years building the family's house, and Melissa, a stay-at-home mother and one-time cafeteria employee at Jacob's school—one older brother, and three older sisters.[2][3][4][5] John emigrated to Australia from the Basque Country at age eight.[6][7]

						While a player on his school's rugby team, Elordi performed in school musicals starting at age 12, starring in productions of Seussical and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and he soon began taking acting classes.[8] He has stated that he was first inspired to become an actor by Heath Ledger, particularly because of his role in the 2008 film The Dark Knight.[9] He also played Oberon in a school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. At age 14, Elordi started practicing his American accent, modelling it after that of Vin Diesel.[2] He attempted modelling at his mother's suggestion at age 15, but was told he was too tall to fit into the sample clothes.[10] Elordi attended the private Roman Catholic, all-boys secondary schools of St Kevin's College, Melbourne, and St Joseph's College, Nudgee, in Brisbane.[5]

						Throughout secondary school, Elordi continued to play rugby until he broke a bone in his back during a match, which, according to him, pushed him away from athletics and toward acting.[10] He has stated that, after reading Waiting for Godot in a theater class at age 15, acting "became [his] church" and his personality changed as a result. His mother also encouraged him to pursue acting.[11] He was inspired by actors such as Marlon Brando, Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis, Christian Bale, and Ledger and would read their biographies while emulating their behaviours.[12] He has stated that he "barely finished high school".[4] He later attended an acting school in Melbourne and moved to the United States in 2017 at age 19 to pursue a career in acting.[10][13]</font></p>
